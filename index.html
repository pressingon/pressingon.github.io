    Welcome. Here is a collection of snippets, observations and
thoughts.  When there are quotations, they may be from people
interviewed on the Jordan B. Peterson podcast or the Socrates in the
City podcast, and when that is the case, you can find out more about the
context by finding the episode that features that credited source.
